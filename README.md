# Crystals collector
1. For this game, the player has to guess the value of the crystals by adding them in order to match a random number given. If your score surpasses the random number then you lose. Enjoy!

## How this works
* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. A random number will be shown too.
* You have to click on the crystals wisely. They will add a specific amount of points to your total score. 
* Your score will be hidden throughout the game and it will only be displayed once you match the random number or when you lose.
* The game restarts whenever you win or lose. There will be another random number to match and the crystals will also have different values.
* There is a counter displaying your total won and lost games troughout the entire session.
